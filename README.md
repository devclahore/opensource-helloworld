## How it works?
You can get started by going through some of the resources linked [below](#Some-useful-resources).
Once you have a reasonable understanding of how to open source projects work, you can start by submitting your first pull request in this repository.

All you have to do is to "append" you name to the list in "Participants.md" file in this repository. This would be a good exercise to practice how git works.

### Note

> Remember, coding isn't the only way to contribute to opensource projects, rather it could be as simple as creating or updating documentation or even helping maintain a project by reporting duplicate issues etc. There are many different ways in which you can contribute to opensource projects. I would recommend going through the following [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute) to find out more about this topic.
